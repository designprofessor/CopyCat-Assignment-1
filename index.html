				<div class="description">Characterized by vignettes, blurring, over saturation, discolored images, Hipstaprints have a casual and seemingly accidental snapshot feel. The Hipstamatic can be downloaded to any iPhone sporting the 3.1 or beyond software update. For $1.99 you can download the base model Hipstamatic which includes a great set of standard lenses, films, and flashes to get started. <A HREF="http://google.com">Additional camera gear</a> is bundled within the app as 'Hipstapaks' and start at 99 cents. Each Hipstapak includes multiple items. <P> Pictures taken with the Hipstamatic have their very own look and unique character. Artistic and painted with light and quirk, Hipstamatic images are sometimes surprising and offer a delicate beauty turning any iPhone into an instant art making machine. Images can be uploaded directly to Facebook, Flickr, or emailed to your friends and family.
